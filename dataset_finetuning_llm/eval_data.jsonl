The signs, symptoms and characteristics of uveitis may include:  Eye redness. Eye pain. Light sensitivity. Blurred vision. Dark, floating spots in your field of vision (floaters). Decreased vision.  Symptoms may occur suddenly and get worse quickly, though in some cases, they develop gradually. They may affect one or both eyes. Occasionally, there are no symptoms, and signs of uveitis are observed on a routine eye exam. The uvea is the middle layer of tissue in the wall of the eye. It consists of the iris, the ciliary body and the choroid. When you look at your eye in the mirror, you will see the white part of the eye (sclera) and the colored part of the eye (iris). The iris is located inside the front of the eye. The ciliary body is a structure behind the iris. The choroid is a layer of blood vessels between the retina and the sclera. The retina lines the inside of the back of the eye, like wallpaper. The inside of the back of the eye is filled with a gel-like liquid called vitreous. The type of uveitis you have depends on which part or parts of the eye are inflamed:  Anterior uveitis affects the inside of the front of your eye (between the cornea and the iris) and the ciliary body. It is also called iritis and is the most common type of uveitis. Intermediate uveitis affects the retina and blood vessels just behind the lens (pars plana) as well as the gel in the center of the eye (vitreous). Posterior uveitis affects a layer on the inside of the back of your eye, either the retina or the choroid. Panuveitis occurs when all layers of the uvea are inflamed, from the front to the back of your eye.

When they occur, signs and symptoms of chondrosarcoma may include:  Increasing pain A growing lump or area of swelling Weakness or bowel and bladder control problems, if the cancer presses on the spinal cord  Causes It's not clear what causes chondrosarcoma. Doctors know that cancer begins when a cell develops changes (mutations) in its DNA. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell it what to do. The instructions tell the cell to multiply quickly and to continue living when healthy cells would die. The accumulating cells form a tumor that can grow to invade and destroy normal body tissue. In time, cells can break away and spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body. Risk factors Factors that can increase the risk of chondrosarcoma include:  Increasing age. Chondrosarcoma occurs most often in middle-aged and older adults, though it can occur at any age. Other bone diseases. Ollier's disease and Maffucci's syndrome are conditions that cause noncancerous bone growths (enchondromas) in the body. These growths sometimes transform into chondrosarcoma.

Most sacral dimples are small and shallow. A sacral dimple is an indentation or pit in the skin on the lower back. It's usually located just above the crease between the buttocks. Causes There are no known causes for a sacral dimple. It is a congenital condition, meaning it's present at birth. Complications Rarely, sacral dimples are associated with a serious underlying abnormality of the spine or spinal cord. Examples include:  Spina bifida. A very mild form of this condition, called spina bifida occulta, occurs when the spine doesn't close properly around the spinal cord, but the cord remains within the spinal canal. In most cases, spina bifida occulta causes no symptoms and doesn't need treatment. Tethered cord syndrome. The spinal cord normally hangs freely within the spinal canal. Tethered cord syndrome is a disorder that occurs when tissue attached to the spinal cord limits its movements. Signs and symptoms may include weakness or numbness in the legs and bladder or bowel incontinence.  The risks of these spinal problems increase if the sacral dimple is accompanied by a nearby tuft of hair, skin tag or lump, and certain types of skin discoloration                  By Mayo Clinic Staff By Mayo Clinic Staff Request an appointment Request an appointment   Diagnosis & treatment Diagnosis & treatment Diagnosis & treatment       Oct. 07, 2022   Print Print  Share on: FacebookTwitter Facebook Twitter Show references Paller AS, et al.

You may excessively focus over one or more parts of your body. The bodily feature that you focus on may change over time. The most common features people tend to fixate about include:  Face, such as nose, complexion, wrinkles, acne and other blemishes Hair, such as appearance, thinning and baldness Skin and vein appearance Breast size Muscle size and tone Genitalia  A preoccupation with your body build being too small or not muscular enough (muscle dysmorphia) occurs almost exclusively in males. Insight about body dysmorphic disorder varies. You may recognize that your beliefs about your perceived flaws may be excessive or not be true, or think that they probably are true, or be absolutely convinced that they're true. The more convinced you are of your beliefs, the more distress and disruption you may experience in your life."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Body Dysmorphic Disorder"}]}

Frostnip doesn't permanently damage the skin. Frostnip, a mild form of frostbite, irritates the skin, causing redness and a cold feeling followed by numbness. Frostnip doesn't permanently damage the skin. Signs and symptoms of frostbite include:  At first, cold skin and a prickling feeling Numbness Skin that looks red, white, bluish-white, grayish-yellow, purplish, brown or ashen, depending on the severity of the condition and usual skin color Hard or waxy-looking skin Clumsiness due to joint and muscle stiffness Blistering after rewarming, in severe cases  Frostbite is most common on the fingers, toes, nose, ears, cheeks and chin. Because of skin numbness, you may not realize you have frostbite until someone points it out. Changes in the color of the affected area might be difficult to see on brown or Black skin. Frostbite occurs in several stages:  Frostnip. Frostnip is a mild form of frostbite. Continued cold exposure leads to numbness in the affected area. As your skin warms, you may feel pain and tingling. Frostnip doesn't cause permanent skin damage. Superficial frostbite. Superficial frostbite causes slight changes in skin color. The skin may begin to feel warm \u2014 a sign of serious skin involvement. If you treat frostbite with rewarming at this stage, the surface of the skin may appear mottled. And you may notice stinging, burning and swelling. A fluid-filled blister may appear 12 to 36 hours after rewarming the skin. Deep (severe) frostbite. As frostbite progresses, it affects all layers of the skin as well as the tissues that lie below. The skin turns white or blue-gray and you lose all sensation of cold, pain or discomfort in the area. Joints or muscles may stop working. Large blisters form 24 to 48 hours after rewarming. The tissue turns black and hard as it dies. "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Frostbite"}]}

Paralysis below the neck, including both arms and legs, is called quadriplegia. Your ability to control your limbs after a spinal cord injury depends on two factors: where the injury occurred on your spinal cord and the severity of injury. The lowest part of your spinal cord that remains undamaged after an injury is referred to as the neurological level of your injury. The severity of the injury is often called \"the completeness\" and is classified as either of the following:  Complete. If all feeling (sensory) and all ability to control movement (motor function) are lost below the spinal cord injury, your injury is called complete. Incomplete. If you have some motor or sensory function below the affected area, your injury is called incomplete. There are varying degrees of incomplete injury.  Additionally, paralysis from a spinal cord injury can be referred to as:  Tetraplegia. Also known as quadriplegia, this means that your arms, hands, trunk, legs and pelvic organs are all affected by your spinal cord injury. Paraplegia. This paralysis affects all or part of the trunk, legs and pelvic organs.  Your health care team will perform a series of tests to determine the neurological level and completeness of your injury. Spinal cord injuries can cause one or more of the following signs and symptoms:  Loss of movement Loss of or altered sensation, including the ability to feel heat, cold and touch Loss of bowel or bladder control Exaggerated reflex activities or spasms Changes in sexual function, sexual sensitivity and fertility Pain or an intense stinging sensation caused by damage to the nerve fibers in your spinal cord Difficulty breathing, coughing or clearing secretions from your lungs  Emergency signs and symptoms Emergency signs and symptoms of a spinal cord injury after an accident include:  Extreme back pain or pressure in your neck, head or back Weakness, incoordination or paralysis in any part of your body Numbness, tingling or loss of sensation in your hands, fingers, feet or toes Loss of bladder or bowel control Difficulty with balance and walking Impaired breathing after injury An oddly positioned or twisted neck or back "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Spinal Cord Injury"}]}

Signs and symptoms depend on which parts of your body are affected. Areas commonly affected by Behcet's disease include:  Mouth. Painful mouth sores that look similar to canker sores are the most common sign of Behcet's disease. They begin as raised, round lesions in the mouth that quickly turn into painful ulcers. The sores usually heal in one to three weeks, though they do recur. Skin. Some people develop acnelike sores on their bodies. Others develop red, raised and tender nodules on their skin, especially on the lower legs. Genitals. Red, open sores can occur on the scrotum or the vulva. The sores are usually painful and can leave scars. Eyes. Inflammation in the eye (uveitis) causes redness, pain and blurred vision, typically in both eyes. In people with Behcet's disease, the condition can come and go. Joints. Joint swelling and pain often affect the knees in people with Behcet's disease. The ankles, elbows or wrists also might be involved. Signs and symptoms can last one to three weeks and go away on their own. Blood vessels. Inflammation in veins and arteries can cause redness, pain, and swelling in the arms or legs when a blood clot results. Inflammation in the large arteries can lead to complications, such as aneurysms and narrowing or blockage of the vessel. Digestive system. A variety of signs and symptoms can affect the digestive system, including abdominal pain, diarrhea and bleeding. Brain. Inflammation in the brain and nervous system can cause headache, fever, disorientation, poor balance or stroke. "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Behcets Disease"}]}

These episodes are called tet spells. Tet spells are caused by a rapid drop in the amount of oxygen in the blood. Tet spells are most common in young infants, around 2 to 4 months old.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Gender dysphoria might cause adolescents and adults to experience a marked difference between inner gender identity and assigned gender that lasts for at least six months. The difference is shown by at least two of the following:   A difference between gender identity and genitals or secondary sex characteristics, such as breast size, voice and facial hair. In young adolescents, a difference between gender identity and anticipated secondary sex characteristics. A strong desire to be rid of these genitals or secondary sex characteristics, or a desire to prevent the development of secondary sex characteristics. A strong desire to have the genitals and secondary sex characteristics of another gender. A strong desire to be or to be treated as another gender. A strong belief of having the typical feelings and reactions of another gender.  Gender dysphoria may also cause significant distress that affects how you function in social situations, at work or school, and in other areas of life. Gender dysphoria might start in childhood and continue into adolescence and adulthood. Or you might have periods in which you no longer experience gender dysphoria. You might also experience gender dysphoria around the time of puberty or much later in life. Complications Gender dysphoria can affect many aspects of life, including daily activities. People experiencing gender dysphoria might have difficulty in school due to pressure to dress in a way that's associated with their sex assigned at birth or out of fear of being harassed or teased. If gender dysphoria impairs the ability to function at school or at work, the result may be school dropout or unemployment. Relationship difficulties are common. Anxiety, depression, self-harm, eating disorders, substance misuse and other problems can occur. People who have gender dysphoria also often experience discrimination, resulting in stress. Accessing health services and mental health services can be difficult due to fear of stigma and a lack of experienced care providers. Adolescents and adults with gender dysphoria without gender-affirming treatment might be at risk of thinking about or attempting suicide.
